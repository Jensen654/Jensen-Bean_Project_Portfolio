# Portfolio Frontend

This project is meant to both portray my skill as a developer, and help others who may not have their own portfolio sites. This project utilizes React on the frontend, and Node.js on the backend. I have incorporated Amazon Web Service functionality with the image uploading and deleting, and I have implemented user data security measures.
